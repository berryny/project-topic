      <h2>Background</h2>
    <p> In history we have had some of the worst outbreaks of diseases dating back to 541 AD. The most severe pandemic that occured, infected 1/3 of the population, and killed 50 million people was the 1918 H1N1 virus. The Mortality was high in people younger than 5 years old, 20-40 years old, and 65 years and older. The high mortality in healthy people, including those in the 20-40 year age group, was a unique feature of this pandemic. With no vaccine to protect against influenza infection and no antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections that can be associated with influenza infections, control efforts worldwide were limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as isolation, quarantine, good personal hygiene, use of disinfectants, and limitations of public gatherings. </p>

      <h2>SARS</h2>
      <p> Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus called SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS was first reported in Asia in February 2003. The illness spread to more than two dozen countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia before the SARS global outbreak of 2003 was contained.</p>

      <h2>Swine Flu</h2>
      <p>Is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza viruses that regularly cause outbreaks of influenza in pigs. This is thought to happen mainly when an infected pig coughs or sneezes and droplets with influenza virus in them spread through the air. If these droplets land in your nose or mouth, or are inhaled, you can be infected.</p>

      <h2>HIV/Aids</h2>
      <p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were first discovered in the early 1980s. AIDS was first detected in American gay communities but itâ€™s thought to have developed from a chimpanzee virus from Africa in the 1920s.Now, according to the most recent data from the CDC from 2006, it's grown to pandemic proportions, with an estimated 65 million infections and 25 million deaths worldwide. An estimated 38,000 new HIV infections still happen in the U.S. each year.</p>

      <h2>Plan</h2>
      <p>Before a Pandemic hits:
Store additional supplies of food and water. Periodically check your regular prescription drugs to ensure a continuous supply in your home.
Have any nonprescription drugs and other health supplies on hand, including pain relievers, stomach remedies, cough and cold medicines, fluids with electrolytes, and vitamins.
Get copies and maintain electronic versions of health records from doctors, hospitals, pharmacies and other sources and store them, for personal reference.</p>
<h2>During a Pandemic</h2>
<p>Please be sure to follow public health guidance as the situation develops.Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
When you are sick, keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too.
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. It may prevent those around you from getting sick.
Washing your hands often will help protect you from germs.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
